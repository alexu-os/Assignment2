# Assignment2
The second Assignment for the OS course. The topic for this assignment would be pthreads!

The assigment is available in a pdf version here.(https://github.com/alexu-os/Assignment2/blob/main/Assignment_2_-_pthreads.pdf)


## Objectives

1. Introducing threads concepts and POSIX threads library.
2. Implementing popular algorithms as multi-threaded ones.

## Problem Statement

It is required to implement two popular algorithms as multi-threaded ones. They are as follows:

## Matrix Multiplication

It is required to implement two variations of this algorithm:

1. The computation of each element of the output matrix happens in a thread.
2. The computation of each row of the output matrix happens in a thread.

For both variations, you have to compute the elapsed time for each of them, compare them and justify your answer.

**The program should read two input matrices from a file in the following format:**

```
[number of rows of 1st matrix] [number of columns of 1st matrix]
1st matrix entries
[number of rows of 2nd matrix] [number of columns of 2nd matrix]
2nd matrix entries
```

**Note: [] for clarity** 

**example input:**

```
3 5
1 -2 3 4 5
1 2 -3 4 5
-1 2 3 4 5
5 4
-1 2 3 4
1 -2 3 4
1 2 -3 4
1 2 3 -4
-1 -2 -3 -4
```

**output format:**

```
[result matrix entries]
END1	[elapsed time of procedure 1]
[result matrix entries]
END2	[elapsed time of procedure 2]
```

**Once again please note that [] is for clarity you shouldn't print it**

## Merge Sort

Merge sort is an O (n log n) comparison-based sorting algorithm. It is a divide and conquers algorithm. Conceptually, a merge sort works as follows:

If the list is of length 0 or 1, then it is already sorted. Otherwise:

1. Divide the unsorted list into two sub-lists of about half the size.
2. Sort each sub-list recursively by re-applying the merge sort.
3. Merge the two sub-lists back into one sorted list

So you are required to implement it using pthreads. Each time the list is divided; two threads are created to do merge-sort on each half separately. This step is repeated recursively until each sub-list has only one element.

**The program should read an array from a file in the following format:**

```
[number of elements]
Array elements which are space separated.
```

**example input:**

```
10
100 20 15 3 4 8 7 -1 0 33
```

 When the program finishes, it should print out the sorted array.

ðŸ’¡ **Please note that in both cases your program should take the name of the input file as an argument**

## Deliverables

Complete source code in **TWO FILES** commented thoroughly and clearly.

- 1st filename is your ID-matrix (e.g., 5237-matrix.c, 5237-matrix.cpp, 5237-matrix.C, 5237-matrix.cc, â€¦)
- 2nd filename is your ID-sort (e.g., 5237-sort.c, 5237-sort.cpp, 5237-sort.C, 5237-sort.cc, â€¦)

## Notes

- Languages used: C/C++.
- Students will work individually.
- You may talk together on the algorithms or functions being used but are **NOT** allowed to look at anybodyâ€™s code.
- Revise the academic integrity note found on the class web page.
